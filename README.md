## **Alchemy API Key Setup**
1. **Create an account on Alchemy:**
    - Go to the [Alchemy website](https://alchemy.com/) and create an account if you don't have one already.

2. **Generate an API key:**
    - Once you have an account, navigate to the API section in your Alchemy account dashboard.
    - Create a new project named WorkInn or any other name if you want.
    - Generate an API key for your project.
3. Add your API key to env.local file setting up the ALCHEMY_ID environment variable.
   ```yml
   ALCHEMY_ID = your_alchemy_id
   ```

## **Setting up Firebase**

Follow these steps to set up Firebase for this project.

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. Make sure to enable necessary services like Firestore, Authentication, and Storage, depending on your project requirements.
   - During the setup, enable Firebase Analytics to leverage powerful insights into your app's performance and user behavior.

2. **Create a Firebase Web App:**
   - In your Firebase project settings, add a web app to generate the necessary configuration details, including the API key, auth domain, and other required parameters. 

3. **Setting up environment variables:**
   - Rename `.env.template` to `.env.local`.
   - Fill in the placeholder values in the `.env.local` file with your Firebase project configuration. Use the Firebase project settings to get the required values.

4. **Service Account Key:**
   - Download the service account key JSON file from the Firebase console.
   - Convert the contents of the JSON file to a string. You can use online tools like [Remove Line Breaks Tool](https://capitalizemytitle.com/tools/remove-line-breaks/) for this.
   - Set the converted JSON as the value for the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` file.
   - Make sure you add value in the env file wrapped with a single quote ie. FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY = 'Service Account JSON content after removing line breaks'.
   - Please make sure that you keep your JSON file in the root directory or delete it once the value is set. Do not expose it while making commits.

5. **Populating Database:**
   - Run the following script using yarn or npm to populate your Firestore database.
     
   ```yml
   yarn populate
   ```
